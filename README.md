# Overlook (aka Pounce)

This project is a a hotel management tool for hotel customers and staff to manage room bookings and calculate customer bills. 
I started the project from scratch and steadily built up the html and css for a customer, then login functionality, then added 
a manager's view. The primary class I'm using is a BookingsEngine that creates booking objects by merging the info brought in 
with the booking API and the info from the room API. The purpose of merging these two sets of information was to have everything 
available in one object (for later checking things like whether a room is booked or not). 

## Tech Stack

## Design Inspiration and wins
My primary design inspiration was [this layout on Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2829139-Atlas-hotel-dashboard/attachments/581022?mode=media). 
I also created a gauge with html/css using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnUkVcQ_3CQ) and also [this codepen](https://codepen.io/andygongea/pen/LyVwEP). 
I used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ophW7Ask_0) to start building my modals with html/css.

## Outcome

The app is 100% responsive and obtains 100% scores on Lighthouse, and can be navigated with tab/enter keys. Layouts did come out 
pretty much the way I wanted them to, without much design sacrificed in the name of code functionality.

## Challenges

I still struggle a bit with understanding scope of promises and async timing, and could definitely benefit from refactoring to better use those features.

## Future iterations

 * Future iterations would include a class for bookings that builds the bookings by merging booking info and room info, and then the engine would 
create a "repository" with that booking info. 
 * Make logging in more adaptable and dynamic (perhaps using local storage). 
 * Refactor the html to only change viewability of certain pieces depending on who is logged in. There is a 
lot of opportunity for refactoring in the html.
